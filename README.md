## Voltage meter for esp32 on wemos 171020 board with OLED screen (SSD1306) in micropython

Measure 12-bit signal on SVN pin (GPIO39).
Auto scaling is supported by switching between the four attenuation levels (0.0-1.0 till 0.0-3.3 Volt range)
With an external resistor divider, higher voltages can be measured.
